**About**

This is the portfolio repository for my CSE321 (Realtime and Embedded OSes) projects.

* Project 1: This project is an introduction to the design process, as well as good coding practices, and involves setting up this repository, creating a header file, as well as correcting poorly written code and documentation.

* Project 2: A timer, that can count down from 9 minutes and 59 seconds or less, displaying the remaining time on an LCD, blinking an LED for each button press, and blinking multiple LEDs when the time is up.

This project covers interrupts, using GPIO through bitwise masking, the Ticker and EventQueue objects, and planning a project from scratch. It also includes integrating an external library, and building a prototype with actual hardware

* Project 3:
This project covers the entire design process, from selection of a project, to planning, to implementation. It also requires the use of new hardware not used in Project 2, and the watchdog timer, as well as implementing critical section protection and sychronization
For this project, I chose to design an adaptive speed limit sign that changes the speed limit based on the temperature an humidity, and displays the speed limit on a 7 segment display
